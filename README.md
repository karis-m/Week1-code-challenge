# Week 1 Code Challenge

## Description
This project involves getting solutions for three challenges which include:Net Salary Calculator, Speed Detector and Student Grade Generator.

## Project Setup

### Steps
1. Open the terminal
2. Clone the gitHub repository.
3. Run the command below to install required dependencies
   npm install
4. To run any of the challenges, use the following command:
   google-chrome index.html
5. Input data through the browser and get the output in the console.

## Challenge 1 (Student Grade Generator)
The code solution accepts marks scored by a student, tests if the marks is in the range of 1-100 and 
otuputs the grade in the following order: A > 79, B > 60 to 79, C > 49 to 59, D > 40 to 49, E > less 40.   
## Challenge 2 (Speed Detector)
The project takes the speed of a car and checks if the speed is less than 70 and outputs “Ok”. But if the speed exceeds 70, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and outputs the total number of demerit points. Incase the demerit points exceeds 12, it displays 'License suspended'.
## Challenge 3 (Net Salary Calculator)
This program accepts the employee's basic salary and all other benefits and calculates the tax depending with the salary bracket.It then calculates the total deductions,which include: NHIF, NSSF and PAYE. Finally it calculates and output the net salary through taking the total income, less the deductions,
