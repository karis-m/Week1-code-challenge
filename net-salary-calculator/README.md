# Net Salary Calculator

## Description
For correct taxation and calculation of employees net income, a good computer program(Calculator) is needed. 
This program accepts the employee's basic salary and all other benefits and calculates the tax depending with the salary bracket.
It then calculates the total deductions,which include: NHIF, NSSF and PAYE. 
Finally it takes the total income and less the deductions therefore getting the net salary.

## Setup
The project has two files i.e index.html and index.js. The index.html file helps in input and output of the calculator, while index.js carries out the calculation.
