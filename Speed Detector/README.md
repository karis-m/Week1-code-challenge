# Speed Detector

## Description
The speed detector program takes the speed of a car as input, If the speed is less than 70, it outputs “Ok”. But if the speed exceeds 70, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit, it gives the driver one demerit point and outputs the total number of demerit points. Incase the demerit points exceeds 12, the driver is suspended

## Setup
The project has two files i.e index.html and index.js. The index.html file helps in input and output of the calculator, while index.js carries out the calculation.
